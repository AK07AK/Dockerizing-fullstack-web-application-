**Containerizing Fullstack web application **

This is an app which uses 
           -> Reactjs as front end
           -> Nodejs as Back end 
           -> MongoDB for Database 
Instead of using Docker, I have used Docker Compose tool inorder to run all the
microservices i.e Front end,back end,database in one go.
